## Components in the Vector Arithmetic Functional Unit (VAFU)
(Reference - Vector Microprocessor Thesis by Prof. Krste Asanovic at UCB)       
* Logical Unit: AND, OR, XOR, etc.    
* Left Shift and Right Shift     
* Multiplier ?Select?       
* Carry Save Adder ?Select?         
* Adder ??
* Comparator & Clipper         

In the VAFU pipeline, the data flows through all the component functional units. This allows for multiple operations to be performed on a single pass.      

In the VFU, sophisiticated Control Logic Circuitry is required to activate/de-activate the component functional units.
